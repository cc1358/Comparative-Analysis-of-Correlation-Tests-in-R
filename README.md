# Comparative-Analysis-of-Correlation-Tests-in-R
This GitHub project empirically compares the power of Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlation tests under different bivariate distributions
The analysis demonstrates:

Pearson's test is more powerful for bivariate normal distributions
Nonparametric tests can outperform Pearson for certain non-normal distributions
The project includes extensive R code with:

Simulation functions
Power calculations
Visualization
Statistical analysis
Comprehensive documentation
